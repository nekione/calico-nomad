## Overview
Nomad supports multi-interface networking and CNI plugins. This allows you to configure multiple network interfaces for a task. Calico is a CNI plugin that provides networking and network policy for containers, virtual machines, and native host-based workloads. 

This write-up is written to demonstrate how to use Calico as a CNI plugin for Nomad as an answer to this [problem statement](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/11748).

Calico can be used as a CNI plugin for Nomad. This guide will walk you through the steps required to set up a Nomad cluster with Calico networking.

## Calico-Nomad over Wireguard VPN

Wireguard is a fast, modern, secure VPN tunnel. Wireguard is a layer 3 tunnel that can be used to create a secure network between hosts (peer-to-peer).

### Problem Statement

We want to create a secure network between two hosts using Wireguard. We want to run a Nomad job on one of the hosts and access it from the other host. We want to use Calico as a CNI plugin for Nomad.

### what we have achieved?

We are able to run a Nomad job on one of the hosts and access it from the other host in the same network. We are able to use Calico as a CNI plugin for Nomad.

### wat we were stuck at?

When we try to access the Nomad job from the other host via the Wireguard tunnel, we are not able to access it. although we are able to ping the host from the other host. containers within the same host are able to access each other. 

For wireguard, we are using netmaker. refer to this [guide](https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker)

### How we fixed it?

We had to enable three things inside calico-node service.

FELIX_VXLANENABLED=true 
IP_AUTODETECTION_METHOD=interface=nm-netmaker 
CALICO_MANAGE_CNI=false

This solved the issue and communcation across netmaker started working.
